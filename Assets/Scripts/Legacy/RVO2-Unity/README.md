# RVO2-Unity (Legacy)

This folder contains the original reference implementation of RVO2 for Unity. 
It is kept for reference purposes and backward compatibility checks.

## Usage
This code uses standard OOP practices and `UnityEngine.Vector2`. 
New development should use the optimized SIMD versions in `Assets/Scripts/Core/RVO`.
